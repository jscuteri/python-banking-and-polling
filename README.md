# Python – Banking and Polling

# Background

# Banking Analysis

•	Given a set of financial data, I have created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of “ABC Financial Company”

•	The metrics that need to be revealed are

o	The total number of months included in the dataset

o	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

o	Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

o	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

o	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

•	In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Polling Analysis

•	Given a set of poll data, I have created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

o	The total number of votes cast

o	A complete list of candidates who received votes

o	The percentage of votes each candidate won

o	The total number of votes each candidate won

o	The winner of the election based on popular vote.

•	In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
